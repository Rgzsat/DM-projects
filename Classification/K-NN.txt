In this procedure, the implementation is divided into the next
steps: 1) Implement the distance function, 2) The calculated
distances are arranged in non-decreasing order for each respective
feature, 3) Take the ”k” nearest neighbor distances from
the sorted list, 4) Find the ”k” points of labels corresponding
to the distances, 5) Assign the points to the closest neighbor,
6) Compare the number of neighbors with the class label of the
original vector to verify accuracy.
