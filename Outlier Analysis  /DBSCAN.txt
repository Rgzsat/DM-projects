Simple implementation of DBSCAN in R

In this case, a pop function has been implemented in R,
all this to remove specific items based on some conditions of
the algorithm. Two functions wereimplemented to start, the first
to calculate the distance using Euclidean methodology, 
and the second to determine the indexes based on the eps neighborhood. 
In the next step, the ”unvisited” collection is implemented with set, the number of
clusters is initialized in parallel with the eps and minimum of
points. Finally, a ”while loop” is initialized and the algorithm
finally divides the data into several clusters, which may cause a
reduction in the number of clusters. If the data volume of the
cluster is less than a certain value, this cluster is considered as
an outlier.
