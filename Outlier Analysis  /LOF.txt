In this exercise, some lists were created to store the variables
”Local reachability density”, ”Local Outlier Factor” and the
”k neighbor index”. Four functions were created to implement
the algorithm.
The first calculate the distance function between a vector of
features and a matrix, the second calculates the ”k nearest
neighbor distances”, the third calculates the local reachability
density, and the last function calculates the LOF value of each
point according.
The number of ”k” is an arbitrary parameter, as well as the
threshold that is required to specify the LOF and classify the
data points as outliers or non-outliers.
