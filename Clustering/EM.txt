The implementation of the EM algorithm has been implemented
with some modifications to the original code. First,
the file ”2gaussiandata.RData” was loaded and a third vector
was generated form the initial column vector. The variables
mu1, mu2, sym1, and sym2 have the same values as in the
2d implementation, however, the 2 covariance matrices were
generated from a normal distribution, considering the initial
values in the initial dataset.
Dimensions of the vector ”logligk” were modified and the
covariance matrices were recalculated with the corresponding
values of tau1, tau2, mu1, mu2, the normalizers and the function
”mysum”.
