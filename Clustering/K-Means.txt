A new implementation of the algorithm has been coded, in
which a matrix of random variables has been generated, specifying
the number of columns and rows. The initial conditions
are the quantity of ”k” values selected, a variable ”r” that
specifies a sample of number ”k” indexes in the dataset, and
the initial centroids considering the ”r” indexes. To initialize
the stopping criteria, two new variables ”diff” and ”cond” are
created, the first indicates the difference between the new centroid
and the previous centroid, the second indicates a counter
for each iteration that is performed to calculate the new centroid.
The algorithm finished when the updated ”diff” value differs
from the initial value.
