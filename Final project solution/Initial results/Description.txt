Initially, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Correlation
test are used to achieve feature selection and illustrate
variance importance based on charging and discharging. Subsequently,
some techniques for parameter estimation in clustering
and anomaly detection algorithms are implemented, finally
the K-Means, DBSCAN and LOF algorithms are executed.
