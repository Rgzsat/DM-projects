K-Means, DBSCAN, and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithms are
executed to identify Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and
their corresponding critical values to assess battery operation.
Main results indicate that Temperature measured, time cycling,
Capacity, and Voltage measured are the main indicators
of battery operation.
